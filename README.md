# Welcome to shift left quality discussion

In this branch, I am committing a slightly complex hello world example, with a lot of checks in pom.xml.

The intent of this branch is to understand how/what are some checks that can be done at desk.

It is very important that we highlight some of the features like spelling mistake & lint issues.
